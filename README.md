# Introduction to MPI
A collection of exercises and implementations exploring Message Passing Interface (MPI) concepts, based on the excellent [CodinGame Introduction to distributed computing with MPI](https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/349/introduction-to-mpi/introduction-to-distributed-computing).

This repository was developed as part of Computer Architecture II (Universidade Vila Velha, 2023) during my Computer Science degree. It demonstrates foundational skills in parallel programming, distributed computing, and high-performance systems.
